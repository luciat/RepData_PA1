```

## Loading and preprocessing the data

Here is the code chunk to read the data.

```{r}
amd <- read.csv("./activity.csv", sep=",")
```

## Mean and median total number of steps per day

Here is the code chunk to aggregate the number os steps by day.

```{r}
days <- c(as.Date(unique(amd$date)))
nd <- length(days)
vSteps <- vector(mode = "integer", length = 0)
for (i in 1:nd) {
      vSteps <- rbind( vSteps, sum(amd$steps[as.Date(amd$date)==days[i]], na.rm=TRUE))
}
```

Now a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day is made.
The mean and median total number of steps taken by day are computed and showed in the graphic.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
meanSteps = mean(vSteps, na.rm = TRUE)
medianSteps = median(vSteps, na.rm = TRUE)
ggplot() + labs(title = "Steps Histogram", x="Number of Steps", y="Number of Days") +
      geom_histogram(aes(x = vSteps), color="black", fill = "green", binwidth=300) +
      geom_vline(xintercept = meanSteps, color = "magenta", size = 2) +
      geom_vline(xintercept = medianSteps, color = "red", size = 2)
```

The mean total number of steps taken by day is `r meanSteps`, represented in the graphic by the vertical line in magenta.

The median total number of steps taken per day is `r medianSteps`, represented in the graphic by the vertical line in red.

## Indentifying the average daily activity pattern

Here is the code chunk to compute the average number of steps taken by 5-minute interval, averaged across all days.

```{r}
intervals <- c(unique(amd$interval))
ni <- length(intervals)
vStepsI <- vector(mode = "numeric", length = 0) 
for (i in 1:ni) {
      vStepsI <- rbind(vStepsI, mean(amd$steps[amd$interval==intervals[i]], na.rm=TRUE))
}
```

Now a time series plot is made to show the average daily activity pattern.

```{r}
ggplot() + labs(title = "Average Daily Activity Pattern", y = "Number of Steps") +
      geom_line(aes(intervals, vStepsI)) +
      scale_x_discrete(name="5-Minute Intervals",
            breaks=c(0000, 0500, 1000, 1500, 2000),
            labels=c("00:00", "05:00", "10:00", "15:00", "20:00"))
```

And this is the code chunk to find the 5-minute interval that contains the maximum number of steps.

```{r}
maxS <- max(vStepsI)
maxI <- intervals[which.max(vStepsI)]
temp <- vector( mode="character", length = 1)
temp[1] <- maxI
temp2 <- mapply(function(x, y) paste0(rep(x, y), collapse = ""), 0, 4 - nchar(temp))
temp <- paste0(temp2, temp)
tMaxI <- format(strptime(temp, format="%H%M"), format = "%H:%M")
```

The 5-minute interval that contains the maximum number of steps (`r maxS`) is `r tMaxI[1]`

## Imputing missing values

Here is the code chunk to compute the number of missing values.

```{r}
nMissValues <- sum(is.na(amd$steps))
```

The number of rows with missing values is `r nMissValues`

Now the missing values are imputed with the strategy that uses the mean of the 5-minute intervals and a new dataset is created.

```{r}
amd$steps[is.na(amd$steps)] <- vStepsI
write.csv(amd, file = "./completeActivity.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```

Here the number os steps by day are aggregated.

```{r}
newVSteps <- vector(mode = "integer", length = 0)
for (i in 1:nd) {
      newVSteps <- rbind( newVSteps, sum(amd$steps[as.Date(amd$date)==days[i]], na.rm=TRUE))
}
```

And a new histogram is made for the complete data set.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
meanSteps = mean(newVSteps, na.rm = TRUE)
medianSteps = median(newVSteps, na.rm = TRUE)
ggplot() + labs(title = "Steps Histogram", x="Number of Steps", y="Number of Days") +
      geom_histogram(aes(x = newVSteps), color="black", fill = "green", binwidth=300) +
      geom_vline(xintercept = meanSteps, color = "magenta", size = 2) +
      geom_vline(xintercept = medianSteps, color = "red", size = 2)
```

The mean total number of steps taken by day is `r meanSteps`

The median total number of steps taken per day is `r medianSteps`

The histogram shows the impact of imputing missing data: the spike around the 0 number of steps has been removed, the median has increased a little and the mean has increased to a value equal to the median, leading to a more symetric distribution.

## Inferring if there are differences in activity patterns between weekday and weekend days

This code chunk creates a new factor variable in the data set with two levels: "weekday" and "weekend".

```{r}
weekDays <- weekdays(as.Date(amd$date))
vDate <- vector( mode = "integer", length = nrow(amd))
vDate <- ifelse(weekDays=="Saturday" | weekDays=="Sunday", 1, 0)
dateFactor = factor(vDate, labels=c("weekday","weekend"))
amd <- cbind(amd, dateFactor)
```

Now a panel plot containing a time series plot of the 5-minute interval and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all weekday or weekend days, is made.

```{r}
vStepsIDays <- data.frame(avgSteps = numeric(), dayType = factor(), interval = numeric())
for (i in 1:ni) {
      vInd <- c(amd$interval==intervals[i] & amd$dateFactor=="weekday")
      newRow <- data.frame(avgSteps = (mean(amd$steps[vInd], na.rm = TRUE)), weekDays = "weekday", interval = intervals[i] )
      vStepsIDays <- rbind(vStepsIDays, newRow)
      vInd <- c(amd$interval==intervals[i] & amd$dateFactor=="weekend")
      newRow <- data.frame(avgSteps = (mean(amd$steps[vInd], na.rm = TRUE)), weekDays = "weekend", interval = intervals[i] )
      vStepsIDays <- rbind(vStepsIDays, newRow)
}
ggplot(vStepsIDays, aes(x = interval, y = avgSteps)) +
      labs(title = "Average Daily Activity Pattern", y = "Number of Steps") +
      geom_line() + facet_wrap(~weekDays, ncol = 1) +
      scale_x_discrete(name="5-Minute Intervals",
            breaks=c(0000, 0500, 1000, 1500, 2000),
            labels=c("00:00", "05:00", "10:00", "15:00", "20:00"))

```
