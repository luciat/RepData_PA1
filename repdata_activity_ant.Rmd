## Loading and preprocessing the data

Here is the code chunk to read the data

```{r}
amd <- read.csv("./data/activity.csv", sep=",")
head(amd)
```

## Mean and median total number of steps per day

Here is the code chunk to aggregate the number os steps by day.

```{r}
days <- c(as.Date(unique(amd$date)))
nd <- length(days)
sly <- data.frame(date=character(), steps=integer())
for (i in 1:nd) {
      newRow <- data.frame(date = days[i], steps=sum(amd$steps[as.Date(amd$date)==days[i]], na.rm=TRUE))
      sly <- rbind(sly, newRow)
}
```

Now a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day is made.
The mean and median total number of steps taken by day are computed and showed in the graphic.

```{r}
hist(sly$steps, col="green", breaks = nd)
meanSteps = mean(sly$steps, na.rm = TRUE)
medianSteps = median(sly$steps, na.rm = TRUE)
abline(v = meanSteps, col = "magenta", lwd = 4)
abline(v = medianSteps, col = "red", lwd = 4)
```

The mean total number of steps taken by day is `r meanSteps`

The median total number of steps taken per day is `r medianSteps`

## Indentifying the average daily activity pattern



## Imputing missing values

Here the number of missing values is computed.

```{r}
nMissValues <- sum(is.na(amd$steps))
```

The number of rows with missing values is `r nMissValues`

Now the missing values are imputed with the strategy ... . A new dataset is created.

```{r}

```

Here a new histogram is made for the complete data set.

```{r}

```

This histogram shows that the impact of imputing missing data is ...

## Infering if there are differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends

This code chunk creates a new factor variable with two levels: "weekday" and "weekend".

```{r}

```

Now a panel plot containing a time series plot of the 5-minute interval and the average number os steps taken, averaged across all weekday or weekend days.

```{r}
```
